# Introduction

Simple app which displays a color on the screen, and the user has to guess the color value out of a set of choices.

# Problems

1. Display the current round number.
2. Generate a random color.
3. Display the color.
4. Generate and display random choices, out of which, one should be the correct answer.
5. Increase the player's score by one every time they guess the correct answer.
6. Display the new score.
7. Display a message saying either correct or wrong answer.
8. Continue game after a short interval when the player gets the answer either right or wrong.

# Diary

-   19:56 - This seems fairly easy.
-   20:11 - Made a rough sketch of the app on Figma. Also decided to change how the game is supposed to work. There will be a score system instead of persistent guessing on the same round.
-   21:36 - Layout looks about finished, possibly done with the design and CSS.
-   21:56 - Added some colors to the design, including gradients on the text and buttons.
