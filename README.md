## Diary

-   19:56 - This seems fairly easy.
-   20:11 - Made a rough sketch of the app on Figma. Also decided to change how the game is supposed to work. There will be a score system instead of persistent guessing on the same round.
-   21:36 - Layout looks about finished, possibly done with the design and CSS.
-   21:56 - Added some colors to the design, including gradients on the text and buttons.
-   23:36 - Kind of forgot to document the rest of the development process. Almost done with the JavaScript now. App is fully functional.
-   00:15 - Tested the app for well over 100 rounds, and added comments in code.
-   00:40 - Finishing touches, and added my favourite link hover effect that I use a lot.
-   18:43 - Fixed a minor bug, where the layout was messed up in smaller screens during the round starting screen.
